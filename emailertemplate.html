            <b>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</b> 
            <br><br>
            We understand that there is a concern during these unprecedented times around health issues
            leading to business continuity risk. In response, we want to provide you with information regarding
             our strategy to mitigate these risks and protect our ability to receive products and services
              rendered from you. 
              <br><br>
First and foremost, we want to assure you that MacroAir Fans is taking this situation very seriously. We have been monitoring and planning accordingly since the initial outbreak in China.

In parallel, we are preparing an additional inventory to ensure we continue to meet ongoing demand in the event a short-term production disruption would occur.
